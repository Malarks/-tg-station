  - tweak: "Updated security jumpsuits to be more consistent across officer/warden/HoS ranks."
 
  - rscadd: "Added tactical armor and helmets to replace the largely unused bulletproof vest in the armory. This armor has higher bullet and explosive resistance than normal armor, and uses the previous, more military armor/helmet sprites."
