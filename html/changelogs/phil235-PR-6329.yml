  - rscadd: "Change to the hunger system. Eating food with sugar temporarily worsens your nutrition drop rate. Eating too much sugar too quickly can make you temporarily unable to eat any sugary food. The nutritional effect of sugar depends on how hungry you are thus it cannot easily  raise your nutrition level past well fed and is best used when hungry. Lots of sugar can make you a bit jittery at times. Eating food with vitamin (new reagent) counteracts the sugar effects and can give you temporary buffs when well fed: it lowers your chance to catch or spread viruses,it makes your body's metabolism more efficient that is it keeps healing reagents longer and evacuate toxins faster and reduces damage from radioactive reagents. Your metabolism gets less efficient if starving."
