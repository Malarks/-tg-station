  - rscadd: Marauders: Due to your extremely great performance as of late, we've added a new equipment room on Mother Base. A lot of your equipment has been moved to this room, as well as some new equipment added onto the Mothership. Take some extra time to familiarize yourself with the placement of your equipment.
