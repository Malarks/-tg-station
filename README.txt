VIROLOGY-V3
================================================================================
https://github.com/kyrahabattoir/-tg-station/tree/virology-v3

>Moved the air supply of virology in a small atmo maintenance area (same layout
	as sec's backup air supply) and replaced the fixed canister (i hate those
	things) by a portable canister/port.

>Rearranged the break room/observation room layouts and the pipe system to have
	less pipes running under walls and get the supply lines more accessible 
	(under door instead of under walls whenever possible)

>To make the room to stuff the atmo area un medbay maintenance i had to nudge
	the south airlock two tiles south and enlarge it one tile west (added bonus,
	the glass is now symetrical)

>The pressure pump allow finer control on the pressure of the virology circuit
	(the old design effectively made the pipes unwrenchable with no way to limit
	the pressure).
