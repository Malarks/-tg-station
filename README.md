This is mostly for my server so i don't have to configure anything.

This branch preconfigure the server to run in extended mode, with a couple of
other tweaks:
* No random events.
* Pre enabled database (you still need to put a password!).

Primarily a test for building colored overlays on sprites, this will add a
variant to the regular handcuffs that have a randomly colored fur sleeve.
Perfect for... "special interrogation".

OTHERS?
================================================================================
Other branches might come and go, they are tweaks and bug fixes aimed for the
tg-station main repository and will be removed as soon as they are merged.
